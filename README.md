# Roblox-Fisch-Macro

- The macro is simply a tool for idle fishing; it cannot replace human precision.  
- The macro is currently in beta, in its Dev version.  
- Any risks involved are your responsibility.  

## Considerations

- This is an idle tool to help you AFK overnight or while working.  
- The macro might occasionally miss a catch, so choose a good fishing spot.  
- I encourage you to play with friends and use your skills instead of the macro, but the choice is yours.  
- I am not responsible for any issues that arise from using the macro.  
- Using this tool is entirely your choice and responsibility.  

## Read This Before Using

- Please disable Windows notifications, as they might interfere with the macro by affecting its scanning process.  
- Ensure your Roblox character does not have white elements (like hair or skin), as the macro uses a white bar for detecting catches. Consider changing colors to improve accuracy.  
- Run the macro with admin privileges to ensure it always gets priority.  
- Disable Windows Defender if necessary, or add the macro and its folder to the trusted or whitelist section in Windows Defender or other antivirus software.  
- Play Roblox in windowed mode and always open Roblox before starting the macro to help it correctly detect your game window.  
- You don't need to download AutoHotKey to run macros, just run the software directly.

**To the game admin for Fisch** *(yes, I'm talking to you "16732694052")*, this is not intended to cause any issues, and I hope you won’t ban me for providing this tool.  
I am not distributing or sharing the software—users find and use it on their own. I am just the creator. Once again, responsibility lies with the users.
