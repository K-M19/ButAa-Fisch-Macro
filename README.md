# Roblox-Fisch-Macro
- The macro is simply a tool for idle fishing; it cannot replace human precision.  
- The macro is currently in beta, in its Dev version.  
- Any risks involved are your responsibility.  

## Considerations
- This is an idle tool to help you AFK overnight or while working.  
- The macro might occasionally miss a catch, so choose a good fishing spot.  
- I encourage you to play with friends and use your skills instead of the macro, but the choice is yours.  
- I am not responsible for any issues that arise from using the macro.  
- Using this tool is entirely your choice and responsibility.  

## Read This Before Using
- Please disable Windows notifications, as they might interfere with the macro by affecting its scanning process.  
- Ensure your Roblox character does not have white elements (like hair or skin), as the macro uses a white bar for detecting catches. Consider changing colors to improve accuracy.  
- Run the macro with admin privileges to ensure it always gets priority.  
- Disable Windows Defender if necessary, or add the macro and its folder to the trusted or whitelist section in Windows Defender or other antivirus software.  
- Play Roblox in windowed mode and always open Roblox before starting the macro to help it correctly detect your game window.  
- You don't need to download AutoHotKey to run macros, just run the software directly.

## Virus Detection
- First of all, I often receive complaints and questions about this issue, most of which are along the lines of: *"Is your software a virus?"*  
- No, my macro is not a virus. It is a compiled version created using AutoHotkey and converted into an executable (EXE) file.  
- The reason it gets flagged as a virus by Windows Defender is that it is compressed using UPX. This causes Defender to misidentify it as malware because UPX modifies how the file's data is stored, making it harder for antivirus programs to analyze its contents. Certain characteristics of UPX compression are often mistaken as malicious behavior by these systems.  
- Therefore, you can either completely disable Windows Defender when downloading or using the software, or add my macro's folder to the *Exclusions* list to prevent notifications or automatic deletion during its operation.

**To the game admin for Fisch** *(yes, I'm talking to you "[[UPD] Fisch](https://www.roblox.com/games/16732694052)" and "[WoozyNate](https://www.roblox.com/users/146089324)")*, this is not intended to cause any issues, and I hope you won’t ban me for providing this tool.  
I am not distributing or sharing the software—users find and use it on their own. I am just the creator. Once again, responsibility lies with the users.
