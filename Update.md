### Really sorry, for this bug I did not detect earlier ("Fisch.ExE" API not Found).


## Update Log (V.42.0)
- Version 42.0 is a slight performance upgrade.
- AutoMatic, improved to detect player rods faster and support more languages [Thank @momo041051 to help languages,Debug].
- Macro is no longer supported on Windows 7/8.1, please upgrade to version 10/11 to continue using.
- The latest Rods will be updated in the next update, I recommend you to use AutoMatic mode.
### AutoMatic mode
- Fisheye sensitivity upgrade, requires game to be above 60FPS for best performance.
- AutoMatic Will require windows 10/11 or later to work.
- AutoMatic No longer requires an exact fisheye image, but simply detects familiar or listed images in the data.
### DRM
- C.P.P (Comprehensive Protection Program), outdated and upgraded to speed up code reading and increase accuracy rate over the old version.
- C.P.P will be renamed to "Bitraven" to be more modern, and more focused and encrypted with 21% strength like Denuvo strength.
- Bitraven will not work with older operating systems like 7/8.1.
### Fisheye
- Upgrade to bring accuracy and 20% delay reduction compared to the old version, but this only works best if the game is above 60FPS.
